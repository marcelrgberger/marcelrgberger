# Marcel R. G. Berger - Apps and beyond  
Software Engineer · Founder · Product Builder  

With over 20 years of experience in software development and system architecture,  
I build and operate scalable mobile applications and backend systems designed for long-term stability.

I am first and foremost a software engineer who builds real products — not presentations, not prototypes.

## About

I design and develop software end-to-end — from product thinking and UX to backend architecture, cloud infrastructure, deployment, and production operations.

As a solopreneur, there is no separation between technical decisions and product responsibility.  
Architecture, performance, security, and operating cost are evaluated together.

My systems are designed to remain:

- Maintainable  
- Economically viable  
- Operationally stable  
- Technically understandable  

AI is integrated pragmatically where it improves automation, analysis, or workflow efficiency — without compromising architectural clarity or long-term maintainability.

Technology is a tool. Structure and responsibility come first.

## Experience

More than two decades of hands-on engineering across startups, enterprise environments, and regulated industries.

Core experience includes:

- Scalable backend systems (Java, Quarkus, Spring)
- Mobile application development (Flutter, native iOS with Swift)
- Cloud-native architectures and Kubernetes deployments
- CI/CD automation and reproducible build environments
- Identity, security, and compliance-sensitive systems
- Full lifecycle ownership: idea → architecture → deployment → operation

I have founded and led a software company, delivered multi-million-euro projects, built cross-functional teams, and established governance and security frameworks for long-term system reliability.

Currently, I lead digital transformation and project coordination within a critical infrastructure environment (KRITIS), focusing on secure cloud architectures and process automation under real operational constraints.

## Book

### Solopreneur – The Art of Working Alone  
A real-world reflection on building, operating, and sustaining products as a solo founder.

The book explores the structural realities of working independently — including responsibility, decision-making, delayed validation, and the systems required to build without a team.

It is written from within the journey, not after it.

## Technical Focus

- End-to-end product engineering
- Production-grade mobile applications
- Scalable backend architecture
- Cloud-native infrastructure
- AI-driven infrastructure automation and autonomous operations
- Long-term maintainability and cost-aware system design

I do not ship experiments.  
I build systems intended to survive production.
