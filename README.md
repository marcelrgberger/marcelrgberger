# Apps and Beyond – Turning Ideas into Products

Hi, I'm Marcel Berger — indie app founder and software architect.

I build, run, and monetize my own apps and selectively take on product-critical client projects.
My focus is on mobile apps and backend systems that remain maintainable, stable, and economical in real-world use.

## About

I design and build production-ready software end-to-end — from product thinking and UX
to mobile development, backend architecture, deployment, and ongoing operations.

I work with **Flutter** and **native iOS (Swift)**, backed by scalable backend systems.
Frameworks are tools, not the goal. Long-term stability, clarity, and operating cost matter more than trends or hype.

## Products

**DokuAI**  
Mobile reporting and documentation for construction sites, service work,
inspections, and property handovers.

**Sommelio** *(in development)*  
Personalized wine recommendations based on taste, occasion, and context.

**PaperlessIQ** *(in development)*  
Smart document management and workflow automation.

## Focus Areas

- End-to-end product development (idea → launch → operation)
- Mobile apps (Flutter, native iOS with Swift)
- Scalable backend architectures (Java, Quarkus)
- Cloud-native systems and CI/CD automation
- Maintainability, security, and long-term stability

## Selective Client Work

I occasionally support teams with:
- **MVP builds**, when clarity and time-to-market matter
- **App audits and rebuilds**, when systems became slow, fragile, or expensive to maintain

Technology is not an end in itself.
I build software that works — today, tomorrow, and years from now.
