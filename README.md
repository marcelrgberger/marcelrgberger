# Apps and Beyond – Turning Ideas into Products

Hi, I'm Marcel Berger — indie app founder and software architect.

I build, operate, and monetize my own apps and selectively take on product-critical client projects.
My focus is on mobile applications and backend systems that are built to survive real-world use:
maintainable, stable, secure, and economically viable over the long term.

## About

I design and build software end-to-end — from product thinking and UX
to mobile development, backend architecture, cloud infrastructure, deployment, and operations.

I work as a solopreneur, which means there is no handover gap between product decisions and technical execution.
Architecture, UX, performance, and operating cost are always considered together — not in isolation.

My technical focus lies on **mobile apps (Flutter & native iOS with Swift)** and
**scalable backend systems based on Java and Quarkus**, deployed in cloud-native environments.
Frameworks are tools, not goals. What matters is that systems remain understandable,
adaptable, and cost-efficient long after the first release.

## Products

I build and run my own products as real businesses — not demos or side projects.
They represent how I work under real constraints.

**DokuAI**  
Mobile reporting and documentation for construction sites, service work,
inspections, and property handovers.

**Sommelio** *(in development)*  
Personalized wine recommendations based on taste, occasion, and context.

**PaperlessIQ** *(in development)*  
Smart document management and workflow automation for everyday business use.

## Selective Client Work

In addition to my own products, I occasionally support teams when the work is
**product-critical** rather than purely operational.

Typical engagements include:
- **MVP builds**, when time-to-market and clarity matter
- **App audits and rebuilds**, when systems became slow, fragile, or expensive to maintain

I do not offer generic hourly development.
Projects are scoped, outcome-driven, and focused on long-term viability.

Technology is not an end in itself.
I build software that works — today, tomorrow, and years from now.
