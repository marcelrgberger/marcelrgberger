# Hi, I'm Marcel Berger

Senior Software Architect, Cloud Engineer & Digitalization Expert – with 20 years of deeply rooted IT expertise  
*Java mastermind • Quarkus visionary • Flutter pioneer • DevOps expert • IT strategist with a hands-on mentality*

---

I’m not a pretender. I’m Hanseatically direct – born and raised in Osnabrück, with a clear edge, technical depth, and a solution-oriented mindset.  
If you’re looking for someone who talks instead of delivers, I’m not your guy.  
But if you need someone who implements digital projects pragmatically, takes responsibility, and isn’t afraid of complexity – then welcome.

My story begins sometime in 1989 or 1990 – no one really knows anymore.  
Facebook didn’t exist, camera film was expensive, and those who wanted to preserve memories needed either a good camera or a damn good memory.  
But the ENERGY STAR logo already existed – and I had my first computer: a Weico computer running Weico DOS.

BASIC was my first language – long before I mastered German grammar. Then came Pascal, C, Java, and Python – and a career that led me through many worlds: from the shell to the cloud, from startups to corporations, from terminals to boardrooms.  
I grew up in a world where the BIOS was configured by hand, stack overflows couldn’t be googled, and memory management was an art. These experiences still shape my engineering mindset today.

---

I develop scalable enterprise backends with Java, automate workflows with Camunda BPMN, move complex systems to the cloud (Azure, Kubernetes, Civo), and build native mobile apps with Flutter.  
I think long-term, with northern clarity, and develop with one clear goal: software that runs. Today, tomorrow, and the day after.

In addition to my passion for software, I spent many years working in hospitality on cruise ships and in upscale hotels.  
I’ve opened bars, led teams, planned events, and inspired international guests. That time taught me: leadership is more than project planning, communication is more than emails, and resilience is more than a buzzword.  
I combine the charm of a host with the analytical depth of an IT architect.

---

I studied business informatics, trained as a restaurant specialist and master bartender (IHK).  
Not only hard at the keyboard, but also hard at the bar. I’m a fan of electronic music and long nights – sometimes for coding, sometimes for celebrating.  
Between lines of code and beats, I find my balance. Structure, pragmatism, and solution-oriented thinking are always my priorities.

I’m like North German weather: clear, straightforward, and deep.  
I analyze like a CTO, act like a captain in a storm – and always stay on course.

If you google me, you’ll find not just code, but concepts. Not just skills, but solutions. Not just projects, but results.  
Welcome to Marcel Berger – the architect behind performant, secure, and economically sound IT. Real. Honest. Efficient.

## Professional Background

I developed enterprise software long before “digitalization” became a buzzword in boardrooms. Whether it’s regulatory financial systems with high security requirements, process platforms in the energy sector, complex identity management solutions, or AI-supported document analysis – I deliver IT solutions that work. Robust, scalable, understandable.

For me, IT is not an end in itself but a strategic tool. I don’t think in features, but in real business value. My systems are designed to be productive tomorrow, expandable the day after, and maintainable and cost-efficient five years from now. I make architecture decisions based on facts – focusing on clean code, maintainability, scalability, security, and operating costs throughout the entire lifecycle.

I currently lead Digitalization and Project Coordination in a critical infrastructure (KRITIS) company. I am responsible for the digital strategy, develop process digitalizations, automation solutions, and secure cloud architectures, lead my team technically and organizationally, and manage complex, high-visibility projects up to executive level.

Previously, I was an entrepreneur and managing director of my own software company for over ten years. During this time, I

- managed multiple multimillion-euro projects – from acquisition to architecture, implementation, and operations  
- built and led cross-functional teams consisting of developers, architects, DevOps engineers, and UI/UX designers  
- developed APIs and microservice architectures that are still in productive use today in finance, industry, and the energy sector  
- established governance, security, and compliance structures to securely and verifiably meet regulatory requirements  
- built CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and automated deployments to significantly reduce time-to-market and operational costs  
- created technical documentation, architecture decisions, and operational concepts that were understandable for stakeholders and precise for developers

I can plan, architect, develop, operate, and explain software. Understandably. Responsibly. Reliably. I combine technical depth with strategic thinking, speak the language of developers and decision-makers, and keep the big picture in mind: business value, quality, security, and sustainable IT architectures.
